      <h2 class="h2">About William S.</h2>
      <p class="p about-copy">WELCOME TO MY GAMING WORLD!<br><br>I'm passionate about computer and video games! The thrill of epic adventures, clever strategies, and endless creativity keeps me coming back every day. I love teaming up with friends and family for co-op battles, funny moments, and friendly rivalries that make every session unforgettable.<br><br>I currently game on the iOS, Switch 2, PC and Xbox platforms. I’m sharing my current top 10 games across these platforms. And I'm also trying to build my own games using vibe-coding AI tools as well as classic hand-coding skills I'm sharpening at school. Am looking forward to learning how to turn my ideas into playable realities!<br><br>Software: To make this website I used OpenAI’s ChatGPT v5.2 and xAI’s Grok v4. To make the games I am using Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet v4.5.<br><br>Hardware: I have an Apple iPhone Pro Max 15, Nintendo Switch 2, and Microsoft Xbox Series X. For my PC setup I have a Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i (Gen 9) PC laptop, ASUS Mini-LED 27” monitor, Logitech MX Anywhere 3S mouse, and Logitech MX keyboard. I also have a really cool neon-effect gamer light (in the shape of a controller) from my sister for mood lighting.<br><br>Thank you for visiting Realm Forge.</p><p class="p about-copy">I love teaming up with friends and family for co-op battles, funny moments, and friendly rivalries that make every session unforgettable.</p><p class="p about-copy">I am a native New Yorker.
